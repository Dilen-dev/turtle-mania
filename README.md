# 🐢 Turtle mania

A fun and interactive turtle race game built using Python's `turtle` graphics module. Players choose how many turtles will race (2–10), and the colorful turtles compete in a randomly driven race across the screen!

## 🕹️ How It Works

- The user is prompted to choose the number of racers (between 2 and 10).
- Turtles are assigned random unique colors.
- The race begins with each turtle moving forward randomly until one reaches the finish line.
- The winning turtle's color is printed at the end.

## 🎨 Features

- Fully interactive and visual experience using the turtle graphics window.
- Randomized turtle movement and color assignment.
- Input validation for user entries.
- Simple, clean code that demonstrates loops, functions, and screen manipulation.

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Built-in `turtle`, `random`, and `time` modules (no external libraries needed)
